This project was developed with the following technologies:
- HTML and CSS
- Git and Github

## 💻 Project
This project involved designing and implementing a responsive layout for a form registration, ensuring compatibility with mobile and desktop devices. The focus was on maintaining a visually appealing and functional user interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, prioritizing usability and accessibility.

In this version, I managed to solve a compatibility issue in iOS 16. I used plain CSS, without nested CSS.
